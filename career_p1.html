            <h4>Curriculum Design Philosophy</h4>
            <p>The curriculum of our department is divided into three parts, providing students 
                with a comprehensive learning system through a combination of required core courses, 
                mathematics and foundational science courses, and engineering professional courses. 
                The core required courses consist of university-wide compulsory courses and essential 
                general education courses, including Chinese, English, History, and other general 
                education subjects.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Core Required Courses: 23 credits in total, including 9 credits of university-wide 
                    required courses and 14 credits of general education courses (comprising both core 
                    required and elective courses).</li>
                <li>Departmental Required Courses: 60 credits</li>
