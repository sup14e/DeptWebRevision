                    The Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE) 
                    at National Central University (NCU) was established in 1981 with the 
                    initiation of its graduate program. In 1988, the Ph.D. program began 
                    enrolling students. The undergraduate program was launched in 1992, 
                    completing a comprehensive academic system in computer science education 
                    and research. Currently, the department hosts 445 undergraduate students, 
                    247 master’s students, 93 in-service master’s students, and 97 Ph.D. 
                    candidates. By 2014, the department had produced 1,399 undergraduate 
                    alumni, 1,291 master's graduates, 240 in-service master's graduates, 
                    and 157 Ph.D. alumni. Thanks to the efforts of faculty, staff, students, 
                    and alumni, the department has earned a distinguished reputation within 
                    Taiwan’s research universities.

            <h1>DEPARTMENT<br>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                NCU’s graduate institute of CSIE was founded in 1981. The Ph.D. 
                program was added in 1988 to train high-level researchers and educators. 
                The undergraduate program began in 1992 to strengthen basic IT education. 
                In 1996, the undergraduate program expanded to two classes per year 
                to meet increasing industry demands. In 2001, the in-service master’s 
                program was introduced to provide further education for professionals. 
                In 2005, in response to policies from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, 
                an embedded systems industry-focused master's program was established 
                to bridge academia and industry. In 2006, recognizing the need for 
                systematic software engineering education in Taiwan, the country’s 
                first Graduate Institute of Software Engineering was launched. 
                It shares resources with the CSIE department but also develops 
                its own distinct goals and curriculum.
