                <h1>Graduate Employment Trends</h1>
                <p>To effectively track the career paths and future plans of our graduates, 
                    we have designed an Exit Survey for graduating students. Additionally, 
                    the university's Career Development Center, in collaboration with the 
                    Ministry of Education, conducts follow-up surveys one, three, and five 
                    years after graduation. The Office of Institutional Research assists in 
                    analyzing the results, supplemented by data from 104 Job Bank, to provide 
                    insights into the post-graduation development of both undergraduate and 
                    graduate students.

                        <p>According to Figure 5-1, most undergraduate students choose to pursue further 
                            education after graduation. Figure 5-2presents a bar chart illustrating graduates' 
                            choices between employment and further study. The majority of those pursuing 
                            higher education enroll in graduate programs at National Central University, 
                            indicating a high retention rate of students continuing their studies at their 
                            alma mater.

                    <h3>Graduate (Master’s & Ph.D.) Programs</h3>
                    <p>Based on Figure 5-3, most Master's and Ph.D. graduates choose to enter the workforce, 
                        followed by those serving in the military. Only a small portion pursue further studies. 
                        Figure 5-4 shows that most graduates are still job hunting at the time of graduation, 
                        while those employed tend to work as software engineers. Company details and positions 
                        are shown in Appendix 5-1. Figure 5-5 highlights that students graduating before 2017 
                        often opted for R&D substitute military service, which not only enhanced work experience 
                        but also made post-service employment easier.

                            Table 5-3 details employment types by year and degree level, showing that roughly 70% of 
                            graduates across all programs consistently work in IT-related jobs.

                            of graduation. Only about 15% take over six months, often due to military service. Professional Master’s 
                            and Ph.D. students typically already have jobs while studying; others also find employment within a month. 
                            This indicates strong competitiveness of graduates in the job market.
