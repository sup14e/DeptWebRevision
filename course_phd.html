                                    results is relaxed. It is no longer restricted to after entering 
                                    the department. However, it is explicitly required that the work 
                                    must be published under the full name of the department.

                                    It is explicitly stipulated that students can use published papers 
                                    to waive the qualification exam, and the author order for the review 
                                    of works is also specified. This regulation is stricter than before 
                                    the revision and will be applied to students admitted starting from 
                                    the 107th academic year.

                                The revision raises the course credit exemption threshold to 90 points and 
                                changes it to "one subject must meet the requirement" for eligibility. 
                                This revision applies retroactively to courses taken from the first semester 
                                of the 105th academic year.

                            thesis reviews and qualification exam exemptions in the 2nd, 8th, and 
                            14th weeks of each semester. The exact application periods for each semester

                        <li>The regulations for exemption of qualification exam subjects in the Doctoral 
                            Program have been reviewed and approved by the department's Academic Committee

                                    The application for exemption will generally follow the same timeline as the 
                                    thesis review application process, with exemption applications accepted during

                                    "Computer Architecture" exam). To apply for exemption based on course grades, 
                                    the course must be completed with a grade before the application is submitted.
